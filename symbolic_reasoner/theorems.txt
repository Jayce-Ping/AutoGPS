# This file aims to write general theorems in formal language style
# All theorems have been added to code to execute for efficiency, so this file is empty now

# The line starts with '#' is a comment line.

# Theorem Example
# Triangle Definition: Line(A, B) & Line(A, C) & Line(B, C) & Not(PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(B, C))) & Not(PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(A, C))) & Not(PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(A, B))) -> Triangle(A, B, C)
